# fa-compiler
A simple compiler that I have written for my Facharbeit (technically a Transpiler, but it serves the purpose)

## Prerequisites
 - Have golang installed, I'm using golang 13.x
 - Have gcc installed

## Usage
 - Clone the repositorie into your GOPATH
 - Run the code, by default it will compile the 'main.fa' file in the same directory
 - (You can also compile it using go and then run it everywhere)

## Command Line Arguments
 - 'file' to specify a different file (needs to include the file-extension)
